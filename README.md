📌 Project Description
This project is a Python automation script that extracts all valid email addresses from a given .txt file and writes them into a new file. It is designed to automate a repetitive and real-life task, fulfilling the requirements of Task 3 under the CodeAlpha Internship Program.

🎯 Features
1.Reads any .txt file containing mixed content.

2.Uses regular expressions to identify valid email addresses.

3.Automatically removes duplicate emails (optional).

4.Saves the extracted emails into a clean output file (emails.txt).

5.Fast and easy to use for bulk extraction.

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
Python 3

1.re (Regular Expressions)

2.File Handling (open, read, write)

3.Basic I/O Automation

💡 How It Works
1.User places or writes the input data in input.txt.

2.The script reads the file contents.

3.All valid email addresses are extracted using a regex pattern.

4.Extracted emails are written to a new file called emails.txt.

🧪 Sample Input (input.txt)
For queries, contact: support@codealpha.tech or feedback@alpha.org.
Other emails: test.user@gmail.com, example@domain.com.

📤 Sample Output (emails.txt)
